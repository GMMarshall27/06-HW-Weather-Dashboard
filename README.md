# 06-HW-Weather-Dashboard
Description:

For this assignment I started from scratch to build a weather dashboard using, JS, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery and API's. I was able to pull the weather data from the current day and 5 day forecast from Openmapweather API. With the data I showed the temp, wind, humidity, and uvi index. The uvi index will also change colors based on the current rating. The dashboard will also store and display all previous searched citites. Below you will find the application link and screenshot.
